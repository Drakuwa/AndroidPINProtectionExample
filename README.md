PINProtectionExample for Android
======================

**PINProtectionExample** is a test Android project developed for helping you implement a PIN protection layer in your application. As for now, the application is not yet available on the Google Play Store, but I will probably release a demo, and until then, you can take a look at its code hosted here.

The application shows a few test welcome fragments on the first run, and a Create PIN fragment, which you can skip, and then redirects to the Main activity. The Main activity in this case is a blank screen with only one "Settings" button which opens an Activity for changing or creating a PIN if it doesn't exist, first showing a PIN entry screen if the PIN is previously set up. 

The application uses the ViewPagerIndicator library from [Jake Wharton](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator "Android-ViewPagerIndicator"), and is licensed with the [GNU GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt "GNU GPLv3") license.
